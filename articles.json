The celebrity-style hour showcased Kelly in a way that could advance her stated interest in becoming the next Barbara Walters, or even Oprah Winfrey -- and invite outside offers.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eOpening the special on a peculiar-looking, almost sci-fi-like virtual set, Kelly showed off a lighter, breezier side. But she also appeared to be trying a bit too hard to approximate the tone of Walters' specials highlighting the year's \u0026#34;10 Most Fascinating People.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eThe centerpiece, not surprisingly, was Kelly's interview with Donald Trump. The GOP frontrunner has repeatedly criticized the host since her tough questions while moderating a Republican president debate in August, building anticipation for their faceoff to a fever pitch.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eIn keeping with the conventions of primetime interviews, though, Kelly kept the conversation personal, not political. In fact, there wasn't a single policy question, or even anything close to one; rather, the Trump talk ranged from potential regrets about things he's said or done during the campaign to failed marriages to the death of his older brother.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u0026#34;Let's talk about us,\u0026#34; Kelly said, as a segue to the rancor that Trump has exhibited toward her.

But if she wanted to present another aspect of herself as a personality, featuring Trump -- while obviously promotable -- wasn't really a good choice. That's because the focus in many quarters will inevitably be on all the questions she didn't pose.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eThe special also contained two wince-inducing elements at the end: An unnecessary lightning round with Trump, asking about things like his favorite movie; and a shameless plug for Kelly's upcoming book.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eOther than Trump, who took up nearly half the hour, \u0026#34;Megyn Kelly Presents\u0026#34; featured a slightly disjointed lineup of guests. Those segments offered a better clue, frankly, of what Kelly can do in the celebrity or personality-driven space.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eKelly was perhaps best with Laverne Cox, the transgender co-star of \u0026#34;Orange Is the New Black,\u0026#34; asking about a suicide attempt in her youth, and whether Cox would have rather been born a woman. (No, she said.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eBy contrast, Kelly's interviews with actor Michael Douglas and defense attorney Robert Shapiro were largely a waste. She didn't even seek the latter's appraisal of John Travolta's odd depiction of him in FX's recent hit miniseries \u0026#34;The People vs. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/17/media/donald-trump-new-york-times/index.html?iid=EL\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 115, 180);\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"inStoryHeading\"\u003eRelated: Donald Trump attorney demands retraction from New York Times\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eFor all that, Kelly did look comfortable in this format.

Even some Fox News critics rallied around Kelly. Meanwhile, the failure of Kelly's colleague Bill O'Reilly to defend her seemed to become a source of internal friction.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eIn various interviews, Kelly has talked openly about considering options when her contract comes up next year, seemingly putting the news star in play.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eKelly has also publicly expressed gratitude toward Ailes and might very well opt to stay put. That includes the prospect of headlining more specials for Fox.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eStill, if Kelly's interests lie along this path, Fox doesn't possess the same history in primetime news as other major networks. ABC, in particular, has a void to fill with Walters and Diane Sawyer significantly scaling back their contributions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eAll that serves as context for \u0026#34;Megyn Kelly Presents,\u0026#34; and its possible role in any future Kelly sweepstakes. Whether that happens remains to be seen, but the host didn't weaken her hand on Tuesday.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eKelly certainly would be in in demand even without the Trump controversy. Yet in terms of raising her profile, his criticism came at an opportune time. To the extent that helped hoist the Fox News star higher into the news stratosphere, it's just one more symbiotic footnote in the relationship between the mogul and the media.\u003c/p\u003e","slug":"megyn-kelly-broadens-profile-with-trump-powered-interview-special","tag":[{"date":"2016-04-17T17:57:03.006Z","__v":0,"name":"NBA Draft Pick","_id":"5713ce6f4959b0bada34d0aa"}],"date":{"$date":"2016-05-19T01:49:23.386Z"},"title":"Megyn Kelly Broadens Profile with Trump-Powered Interview Special","__v":0}

He brings plenty of rebounding (including offensive). He's good at the rim on defense and he should up their perimeter screen defensive game...something they desperately need. He's strong and has an NBA body and a half. Like most current Portland bigs, his offense is presentable as long as he's glued to the rim, shaky otherwise. But he'll know his role offensively. They're not bringing him in to score 20. The Blazers bolstered what they already had, adding a few wrinkles and another live body.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"paragraph5\" class=\"pgh-paragraph\" style=\"color: rgb(41, 41, 41);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eHands down the most brilliant part of the deal was getting Ezeli on the cheap. A sub-$8 million per year contract with a team option in the second year is a steal in this environment. It cleverly mitigates faults from the extreme ends of the bell curve. If Ezeli excels he's going to get a new, bigger contract soon. If his knees give out the Blazers aren't stuck with him. There's no huge downside for anyone involved.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"paragraph6\" class=\"pgh-paragraph\" style=\"color: rgb(41, 41, 41);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eIn that vein, your analysis is spot on. It's a relatively low-cost move and there's not much wrong with it. Well done.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"paragraph7\" class=\"pgh-paragraph\" style=\"color: rgb(41, 41, 41);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eAs for the rhetoric about 54 wins...I suspect that'll be difficult, but fair enough. Predicting wins is difficult. That would certainly mark a significant improvement. If the Blazers make it there because of Ezeli or anyone else, they deserve a pat on the pack.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"paragraph8\" class=\"pgh-paragraph\" style=\"color: rgb(41, 41, 41);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eWhen considering whether this was THE move or not, or signals a new era in free agency relations, the outlook is more measured. This isn't a new leaf in, or departure from, Portland's free agency plans as much as a continuation of them. It's a bargain signing of a value player who's not likely to transform the team in the same way a premium free agent would.

That's been Portland's M.O. for years and it continues to be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"m-ad m-ad__native_ad_mobile\" style=\"text-align: center;color: rgb(41, 41, 41);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"div-gpt-ad-native_ad_mobile\" class=\"dfp_ad\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp id=\"paragraph9\" class=\"pgh-paragraph\" style=\"color: rgb(41, 41, 41);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eSigning Ezeli does not cancel out missing out on the free agent targets that came before him, nor was he Plan A for the off-season. His health is in question (one of the possible reasons the contract number came in low) and it's impossible to project whether he'll be a starter, reserve, or off the team entirely two years from now. This is the type of signing that keeps the wheels greased while you work on other things. Those \u0026#34;other things\u0026#34; will still be key. It'll be interesting to see if the Blazers can manage them without high draft picks or a ton of cap space on the horizon. Keep on the watch for trades...but then again, the cupboard's not exactly bursting there either. The Blazers have serious challenges in front of them if they want to contend. This move did not resolve those challenges.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"paragraph10\" class=\"pgh-paragraph\" style=\"color: rgb(41, 41, 41);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eSigning Festus Ezeli for a modest amount was a brilliant move in isolation, a semi-decent back-up move when the Blazers couldn't get other free agents to accept their offers, but probably not the kind of move that will lift the franchise over the next hurdle. Tactically it was sound. Strategically? We'll have to wait and see how it plays out. It could be the prelude to the next step or it could be an attempted bail-out from a rough free agent situation the Blazers couldn't resolve. If so, that situation is the real issue, not Ezeli's success or failure. There's no downside to signing him, but he doesn't answer the bigger questions either.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"paragraph11\" class=\"pgh-paragraph\" style=\"color: rgb(41, 41, 41);background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003eSend your Mailbag questions along to blazersub@gmail.com and we'll get them answered one way or another!\u003c/p\u003e","slug":"why-festus-ezeli-is-a-diamond-in-the-rough-for-the-blazers","tag":[{"date":"2016-04-17T04:33:48.670Z","type":"team","division":"northwest","conference":"western","image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/06/Portland_Trail_Blazers_alternate_logo.svg/926px-Portland_Trail_Blazers_alternate_logo.svg.png","__v":0,"name":"Portland Trail Blazers","_id":"5713122c6f217179d8a721f2"},{"date":"2016-07-05T04:48:59.308Z","type":"team","division":"pacific","conference":"western","image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/01/Golden_State_Warriors_logo.svg/838px-Golden_State_Warriors_logo.svg.png","__v":0,"name":"Golden State Warriors","_id":"577b3c3b2ec515ac385079db"},{"date":"2016-04-17T03:38:03.426Z","type":"league","division":"none","conference":"none","image":"http://www.officialpsds.com/images/thumbs/NBA-logo-psd15019.png","__v":0,"name":"NBA","_id":"5713051b6342f671d81c1ae5"}],"date":{"$date":"2016-07-09T19:23:49.278Z"},"title":"Why Festus Ezeli Is a Diamond in the Rough for the Blazers","__v":0}

His left arm stanches their wounds. He has been a starter this October and he has been a closer. The Dodgers have won all four games in which Kershaw has pitched this postseason. They’ve lost all the others. The team hopes to buck that trend in Game 3 on Tuesday at Dodger Stadium.Kershaw played his part with aplomb in Game 2. Chicago managed only two hits. No Cub advanced beyond second base. Kershaw handed the game over to closer Kenley Jansen in the eighth inning. Jansen notched a six-out save, protecting a lead created by an Adrian Gonzalez homer in the second inning.Kershaw did not give up a hit until the fifth inning. He did not reach a three-ball count until the sixth. He survived the seventh inning, the setting for so much of his October heartbreak, when Cubs second baseman Javier Baez smashed a line drive into Joc Pederson’s glove at the warning track.A heavy October workload for Kershaw is nothing new. \u003c/p\u003e","slug":"dodgers-defeat-cubs-1-0-to-even-nlcs-at-one-game-apiece","tag":[{"date":"2016-04-17T03:38:03.426Z","type":"league","division":"none","conference":"none","image":"http://mlbtoportland.com/images/logos/mlb.png","__v":0,"name":"MLB","_id":"5713051b6342f671d81c1ae5"},{"date":"2016-07-06T04:35:56.423Z","type":"team","division":"nlcentral","conference":"national","__v":0,"image":"http://mlbtoportland.com/images/logos/cubs.png","name":"Chicago Cubs","_id":"577c8aac7cde52193d90ca4b"},{"date":"2016-07-05T04:50:05.735Z","type":"team","division":"nlwest","conference":"national","image":"http://mlbtoportland.com/images/logos/dodgers.png","__v":0,"name":"Los Angeles Dodgers","_id":"577b3c7d2ec515ac385079dc"}],"date":{"$date":"2016-10-17T04:27:05.178Z"},"title":"Dodgers defeat Cubs, 1-0, to even NLCS at one game apiece","__v":0}

So you try to balance it out.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"width: 600px;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"\u003eFive of the seven regulars are hitting below .200 for the postseason, most notably Anthony Rizzo (1-for-23) and Addison Russell (1-for-22). Jason Heyward (2-for-18), Dexter Fowler (4-for-24) and Ben Zobrist (4-for-22) have also been fighting through an October funk.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"width: 600px;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"\u003eDespite the lineup-wide struggles, don't look for Maddon to make any major changes to his lineup during the three games at Dodger Stadium.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"width: 600px;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"\u003e\u0026#34;There's only so much you can possibly do when it comes to manipulating your lineup,\u0026#34; Maddon said. \u0026#34;These are the guys that got you here. These are your guys. We've got a bunch of All-Stars out there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"width: 600px;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"\u003e\u0026#34;When you get to this point, you've got five games left to really make it right as opposed to 75 to make it right. There is a difference with that. There are certain things you'd do in the middle of the season in order to move something along, just not during the playoffs.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"width: 600px;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"\u003eSome of Chicago's troubles can certainly be attributed to the quality of pitching in the postseason, where the Cubs have already seen Johnny Cueto, Jeff Samardzija, Madison Bumgarner, Matt Moore and Clayton Kershaw.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"width: 600px;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"\u003e\u0026#34;There's a lot of Cy Young candidates among that group,\u0026#34; Maddon said. \u0026#34;We have to do a good job consistently among position players to do what we're capable of doing, absolutely. But we have seen some really good pitching. I'll defend them in that regard.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"width: 600px;color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"\u003eBut if the Cubs are to break their 71-year drought without a trip to the World Series - or, more importantly, their 108-year streak without a championship - they'll need some of their sluggers to start swinging bigger sticks.\u003c/p\u003e","slug":"cubs-struggles-at-plate-a-glaring-issue-as-they-head-to-game-3-vs-dodgers-tied-1-1","tag":[{"date":"2016-07-06T04:35:56.423Z","type":"team","division":"nlcentral","conference":"national","__v":0,"image":"http://mlbtoportland.com/images/logos/cubs.png","name":"Chicago Cubs","_id":"577c8aac7cde52193d90ca4b"},{"date":"2016-07-05T04:50:05.735Z","type":"team","division":"nlwest","conference":"national","image":"http://mlbtoportland.com/images/logos/dodgers.png","__v":0,"name":"Los Angeles Dodgers","_id":"577b3c7d2ec515ac385079dc"},{"date":"2016-04-17T03:38:03.426Z","type":"league","division":"none","conference":"none","image":"http://mlbtoportland.com/images/logos/mlb.png","__v":0,"name":"MLB","_id":"5713051b6342f671d81c1ae5"}],"date":{"$date":"2016-10-18T03:28:12.463Z"},"title":"Cubs' struggles at plate a glaring issue as they head to Game 3 vs. Dodgers tied, 1-1","__v":0}
